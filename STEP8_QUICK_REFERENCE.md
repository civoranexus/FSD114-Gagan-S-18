1. Enroll in a course
2. Mark all content as complete
3. Check progress: should be 100%
4. Go to Dashboard → Certificates

### API Test
```bash

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Course not yet completed"
- **Cause**: Progress is not 100%
- **Solution**: Mark all content items as complete

### Issue: "You are not enrolled in this course"
- **Cause**: Student is not enrolled
- **Solution**: Enroll in course first

### Issue: PDF download not working
- **Cause**: File storage issue
- **Solution**: Check certificates folder permissions

### Issue: Same certificate generated twice
- **Cause**: Unique constraint prevents duplicates
- **Solution**: Returns existing certificate (200 OK)

### Issue: 500 Error on generate
- **Cause**: reportlab not installed
- **Solution**: `pip install reportlab`

---

## Dependencies

### Install in Backend
