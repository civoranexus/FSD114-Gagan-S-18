## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "403 Forbidden" when accessing `/admin/create-course`
**Solution**: 
- Verify you're logged in as an admin user
- Check localStorage for correct role: `localStorage.getItem('role')` should be 'admin'
- Verify JWT token is valid: `localStorage.getItem('access')`

### Issue: Form submission shows "Network error"
**Solution**:
- Ensure Django backend is running on https://edu-village-6j7f.onrender.com/
- Check browser console (F12) for specific error
- Verify JWT token hasn't expired
- Check CORS settings if making from different origin

### Issue: Course doesn't appear after creation
**Solution**:
- Check if API returned 201 status (not 200)
- Verify course was saved in database: `Course.objects.all()` in Django shell
- Check if you're viewing as correct admin user

### Issue: Can see button but can't navigate to form
**Solution**:
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Refresh page and try again
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Database Queries

### View All Courses (Django Shell)
```python
python manage.py shell
>>> from apps.courses.models import Course
>>> Course.objects.all()
>>> Course.objects.filter(status='draft')
>>> Course.objects.filter(status='published')
```

### Check Admin User
```python
>>> from apps.users.models import User
>>> admin_user = User.objects.filter(role='admin').first()
>>> admin_user.username
```
