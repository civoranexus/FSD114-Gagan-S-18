---

## API Endpoints Verification

### 1. Generate Certificate
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/courses/student/<course_id>/generate-certificate/`
- **Auth:** Bearer token (required)
- **Permissions:** IsAuthenticated, IsStudent
- **Success:** 201 Created (new) or 200 OK (exists)
- **Response:** CertificateSerializer data
- **Error 400:** Course not 100% complete
- **Error 403:** Not enrolled in course

### 2. List Certificates
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/courses/student/certificates/`
- **Auth:** Bearer token (required)
- **Permissions:** IsAuthenticated, IsStudent
- **Success:** 200 OK
- **Response:** `{total_certificates: int, certificates: [...]}`

### 3. Download Certificate
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/courses/student/certificates/<certificate_id>/download/`
- **Auth:** Bearer token (required)
- **Permissions:** IsAuthenticated, IsStudent
- **Success:** 200 OK + PDF file blob
- **Error 403:** Not certificate owner
- **Error 404:** Certificate or file not found
- **Error 500:** Server error

## Error Scenarios Handled

### Backend Errors

| Error | Status | Message | Cause |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|
| Invalid Token | 401 | Unauthorized | No auth header |
| Not Student | 403 | Permission Denied | Non-student user |
| Not Owner | 403 | "You don't have permission..." | Wrong student |
| No File | 404 | "Certificate file not found" | DB record missing file |
| File Deleted | 404 | "Certificate file does not exist on server" | File removed from storage |
| Server Error | 500 | "Error downloading certificate..." | Unexpected exception |

### Frontend Error Handling

1. **Generation Fails**
   - Toast: "Failed to generate certificate. Complete all course content first."
   - Button returns to normal state

2. **Download Fails**
   - Toast: "Failed to download certificate. Please try again."
   - Button returns to normal state

3. **API Fetch Fails**
   - Toast: "Error retrieving certificate. Please try again."
   - Page handles gracefully

4. **Network Error**
   - Toast: "Failed to load certificates"
   - Error message displayed on page

---

## Security Verification

### Authentication
- ✅ All endpoints require Bearer token
- ✅ Unauthenticated users cannot access
- ✅ Invalid tokens rejected

### Authorization
- ✅ Students can only see their own certificates
- ✅ Students cannot download other students' certificates
- ✅ Backend verifies ownership before file serving
- ✅ Download endpoint checks `certificate.student == request.user`

### File Security
- ✅ Files served with proper MIME type (`application/pdf`)
- ✅ Download filename sanitized (spaces → underscores)
- ✅ File paths validated
- ✅ Non-existent files return 404 (not 500)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied
- ✅ `select_related('course')` in certificate queries
- ✅ Single query for certificate list (no N+1)
- ✅ Efficient blob download handling
- ✅ Proper file cleanup (revoke URLs)

### Database Queries
- ✅ Certificate model indexed on (student, course) unique together
- ✅ File queries cached by Django ORM
- ✅ No unnecessary queries in download flow

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run Django migrations (if any new models)
- [ ] Collect static files: `python manage.py collectstatic`
- [ ] Run tests: `python manage.py test apps.courses`
- [ ] Check for console errors in browser
- [ ] Verify media directory permissions (writable)
- [ ] Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- [ ] Verify certificate PDF generation works
- [ ] Check file upload path exists: `media/certificates/`
- [ ] Test with production-like data volumes
- [ ] Monitor Django logs for errors

---

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

### Happy Path
1. ✅ Student completes course (100%)
2. ✅ Downloads certificate from course page
3. ✅ File downloads successfully
4. ✅ Navigates to "My Certificates"
5. ✅ Certificate appears in gallery
6. ✅ Downloads from gallery
7. ✅ File downloads again successfully

### Edge Cases
1. ✅ Rapid successive downloads
2. ✅ Different file sizes
3. ✅ Special characters in course names
4. ✅ Multiple courses with same name
5. ✅ Certificate with missing student name
6. ✅ Very long course titles

---

## Monitoring & Logging

### Logs to Monitor

**Django Backend:**
- Certificate generation success/failure
- File download access (who, when)
- Permission denied attempts
- Server errors during download

**Frontend Console:**
- API request/response timing
- Download success/failure
- Network errors
- Unauthorized access attempts

## Quick Reference

### For Developers

**To test certificate generation:**
```bash
# Complete a course to 100%
# Click "Download Certificate" button
# Check browser console for success/error
# Verify PDF file downloads
```

**To test API directly:**
```bash
# Get certificates
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/courses/student/certificates/

# Download certificate
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -O http://localhost:8000/api/courses/student/certificates/1/download/
```

**To debug frontend:**
```javascript
// Check certificate fetching
axios.get('https://edu-village-6j7f.onrender.com/api/courses/student/certificates/')

// Check certificate generation
axios.post('https://edu-village-6j7f.onrender.com/api/courses/student/1/generate-certificate/', {})

// Check file download
fetch('https://edu-village-6j7f.onrender.com/api/courses/student/certificates/1/download/', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer TOKEN' }
})
```
