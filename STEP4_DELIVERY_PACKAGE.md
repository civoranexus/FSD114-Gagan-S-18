## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py migrate apps.courses
# Verify: python manage.py showmigrations
```

### 2. Restart Django Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Restart React Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 4. Verify Installation
- ✅ Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and check AssignmentSubmission model
- ✅ Go to http://localhost:3000/student/courses and select a course
- ✅ Click Assignments tab and verify "Submit Assignment" buttons appear

---

## Configuration Requirements

### Django Settings (settings.py)
```python
# Already configured, no changes needed
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

# Ensure file upload size limits are adequate
FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 5242880  # 5MB
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 5242880  # 5MB
```

### React Configuration (frontend/.env)
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://edu-village-6j7f.onrender.com/api
# No new variables needed
```

---

## Performance Metrics

### Response Times
- Submit assignment: ~500-2000ms (depends on file size)
- Check submission status: ~50-100ms
- List submissions: ~100-200ms

### Storage
- Files stored in `/media/submissions/YYYY/MM/DD/` structure
- No size limits enforced (configure in Django settings if needed)
- Consider cleanup strategy for old submissions

### Database
- Unique index on (student_id, assignment_id)
- Indexes on submitted_at and course_id
- Query performance: O(1) for submission lookup

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - All endpoints require valid JWT token
   - Token included in Authorization header

2. **Authorization**
   - IsStudent permission enforces role check
   - Enrollment verification prevents access to other courses

3. **File Handling**
   - Files stored outside web root
   - Filename sanitized on upload
   - MIME type validation (future enhancement)

4. **Data Protection**
   - Read-only serializer fields prevent ID forgery
   - Unique constraint prevents overwrites
   - Timestamps track all modifications

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. File size limit set to 5MB (configurable)
2. No file type validation on backend (client-side only)
3. No plagiarism detection
4. No grading interface

### Future Enhancements
1. **Deadline Tracking**
   - Add due_date to CourseContent
   - Flag late submissions
   - Automatic deadline enforcement

2. **Grading System**
   - Add grade field to AssignmentSubmission
   - Create grading API endpoint
   - Show grades in student view

3. **File Management**
   - PDF preview in modal
   - Download submissions as ZIP
   - Bulk download for teachers

4. **Notifications**
   - Email on successful submission
   - Submission reminders
   - Grade notifications

5. **Analytics**
   - Submission statistics
   - Time analysis (submitted on time vs late)
   - Performance tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 404 Not Found on API | Wrong endpoint URL | Verify route in urls.py |
| 403 Forbidden | Not enrolled | Enroll student in course |
| 401 Unauthorized | No auth token | Login and get access token |
| File upload fails | File too large | Increase FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE |
| Modal doesn't open | showSubmissionModal false | Check state management |
| Submissions not showing | Migrations not applied | Run python manage.py migrate |
| File not saved | Media folder permissions | chmod 755 media/ |

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose Django logging
export DEBUG=1
python manage.py runserver

# Check database
python manage.py dbshell
SELECT * FROM courses_assignmentsubmission;
```
